# Sringboot And Reactjs Project
# In this project I create a car database application where I Impliment Rest API 
# I use restful web services to perfom CRUD operations
# How?
# This project contains Entity classes
# Entity claases, I am using ORM, JPA, and Hibernate to create database tables
# ORM(Objecct Relational Mapping) is a technique where by I can fetch from and manipulate my database using an Object Oriented programming paradigm.The Fields of my entity
 class become my database columns, 
# The table name will be the same as the class name
# The @Entity annotation marks this class as a table schema   
# JPA(Java Persistance API) provides ORM for java developers. The JPA entity is a java class that represents the structure of a adatabase table
# Hibernate is used to implement JPA
# restful webservices enable us to perform HTTP requests.
# To create HTTP requests using Rest web services we create a RestController class annotated by @RestController  
# With this I can reuqest map to a page that operate on different CRUD operations
